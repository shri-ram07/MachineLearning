This dataset is made up of 1797 8x8 images. 
Every point on metrix represent pixel intensity
Each image, like the one shown below, is of a hand-written digit. 
In order to utilize an 8x8 figure like this, 
weâ€™d have to first transform it into a feature vector with length 64 (features)"""

The enumerate() function in Python is a built-in function that adds
 a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object.
  This function is particularly useful when you need to loop 
  over an iterable and keep track of the index of each item."""
